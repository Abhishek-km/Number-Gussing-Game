Requirements
It is a CLI-based game, so you need to use the command line to interact with the game. The game should work as follows:

1) When the game starts, it should display a welcome message along with the rules of the game.
2) The computer should randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
3) User should select the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) which will determine the number of chances they get to guess the number.
4) The user should be able to enter their guess.
5) If the user’s guess is correct, the game should display a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took to guess 
   the number.
6) If the user’s guess is incorrect, the game should display a message indicating whether the number is greater or less than the user’s 
   guess.

The game should end when the user guesses the correct number or runs out of chances.

Here is a sample output of the game:
